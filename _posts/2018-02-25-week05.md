### What I Look for When Selecting an Open Source Project to Work on
One thing I consider when choosing what project to work on is how interested I am in the project. I want to contribute to projects that I genuinely think are fun, exciting or impactful. After all, I'm going to be making these contribtutions during my own free time--so I don't want these contributions to be considered chores or as if I could be spending my time doing something else. The aforementioned feelings are avoided if I am able to work on a project that I am passionate about.
