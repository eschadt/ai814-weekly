### Group Project Progress
I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/9047) this past week. The process for submitting a pull request for Zulip involves a number of steps, including providing a screenshot/GIF of the fixed issue and passing several automated tests. After my initial commits failed to pass a test, I updated the pull request with another commit that now passes all test cases. It is now awaiting review.
