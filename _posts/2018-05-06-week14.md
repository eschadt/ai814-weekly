### Course Reflection

#### What I Learned
I certainly learned a lot over the course of this semester. Before taking this course, the idea of contributing to open source projects was something I thought about but never acted on because I had no idea where to start. Now I feel like I am capable of looking for open source projects that I am interested in and joining their communities. 

I grew more comfortable with Git and GitHub, especially when it comes to tracking/submitting issues and creating forks and pull requests. Working on Zulip with my classmates was also a valuable experience, as it was the first time I got involved in a large scale open source project and it made me interested in continuing to contribute to open source projects even after this course has ended.

#### What I Wish I had Learned
I think it would have been beneficial to learn about some common testing and debugging tools and methods.
