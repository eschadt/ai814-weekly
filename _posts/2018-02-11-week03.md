### My Contribution to Wikipedia
The article that I chose to contribute to is the one about [purple squirrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_squirrel_(animal)). I chose this article in particular because the topic is obscure and the article is short, indicating that it has the most potential for editing. Also, I think squirrels are interesting and purple squirrels are even more interesting than normal squirrels.

I contributed to the article by fixing a dead link. One of the external links led to a 404 error, which means that most likely the website changed or deleted the page that was being referenced. To fix this, I used https://web.archive.org/ to find a snapshot of the page before it was taken down and I modified the link to send users to the snapshot I found.
