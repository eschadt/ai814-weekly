I'm a senior at New York University who is majoring in computer science. I hope to use my technical skills to contribute to the development of cool and innovative technologies. I'm excited to begin my journey into open source software development and have no doubt that I will have fun a learn a lot doing so.  

My interests include video games, basketball, reading, and solving puzzles.
